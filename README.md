# Discord-Music-Bot
This is a music bot for your Discord server.

Advantages:
 - I commented everything out, so it's easy to figure it out
 - All setup in one file
 - Checking for the server (It is necessary so that when using the bot on several servers, no crashes occur)

---

> # Instructions
## Discord Bot:
 - [Create application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
 - Add a bot to it (Bot section)
 - In the same place where the bot was added, enable "PRESENCE INTENT" and "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" (Without this, the bot will not work)
 - Add a bot to the server (here it is already)

## Customizing the Config.json File
 ```js
 {
    "BOT_TOKEN": "Enter_discord_bot_token",

    "DEBUG_EVENT": false
 }
 ```
 
The bot token can be copied in the Bot section of [your application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## To run locally, you need Node.JS
